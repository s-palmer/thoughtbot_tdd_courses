# Test Doubles / Stubs With Constraints

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Test Doubles](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/test-doubles) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

When stubbing out a method, sometimes the arguments to that method are important for producing the correct result. For example, you may want to make sure a query has a `LIMIT` clause set on it:

``` ruby
Post.limit(per_page)
```

This stub won't be enough:

``` ruby
allow(Post).to receive(:limit).and_return(posts)
```

Calling `limit` with a different number (or even no number at all!) would still cause this test to pass. You need to set a constraint on the arguments:

``` ruby
allow(Post).to receive(:limit).with(10).and_return(posts)
```

In this exercise, you'll use `with` in order to test methods with important arguments.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/stubs-with-constraints.git
    cd stubs-with-constraints
    bin/setup

After running `bin/setup`, edit `spec/dashboard_spec.rb` and use `double`, `allow`, and `with` to clean up test logic duplicated from `spec/post_spec.rb`.
