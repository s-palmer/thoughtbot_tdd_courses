Use TDD principles to build out name functionality for a Person.
Here are the requirements:
- Add a method to return the full name as a string. A full name includes
  first, middle, and last name. If the middle name is missing, there shouldn't
  have extra spaces.
- Add a method to return a full name with a middle initial. If the middle name
  is missing, there shouldn't be extra spaces or a period.
- Add a method to return all initials. If the middle name is missing, the
  initials should only have two characters.
We've already sketched out the spec descriptions for the #full_name. Try
building the specs for that method, watch them fail, then write the code to
make them pass. Then move on to the other two methods, but this time you'll
create the descriptions to match the requirements above.
